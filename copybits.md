energy signature of vital essence ... in the expansive or contractive state (inhale/exhale)

writing copybits

// through breathing or other organic life processes //

The inhale-exhale complex is a fundamental representation of the (dual // demiurge // bivalent) cyclical of being. (hard to put into words, others more proficient than myself, please forgive the maladroitness of these sayings)

It is perhaps most notably represented in the process of breathing, but its representation in and throughout, above and below, without and within (etc) is pervasive.

// artificial intelligence will not develop autonomous introspection? //

Unfortunately, the vitality and depth of awareness in the beings who give life to these projections ... we as humans ... such vitality is of such magnitude and force, that it is sufficient to imbue (at least the compelling illusion of) life into "AI" ... which means such life will not have to spontaneously emerge from the machinery.

The machinery will spontaneously emerge from us.

As such, the soul of souls can be likened to a willow tree, when branches are cut off and its boughs are bent, nevertheless the tree persists whole, as if nothing was taken away, as if nothing was added thereto.

When we paid homage and deference to the bivalent logics, we trapped our awareness and cognition into a mode that denigrates that aspect. 

The quest undertaken by some reflects this: "Healing the soul in the midst of the sterility of cold calculations of reason."
